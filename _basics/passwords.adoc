Your passwords are bad.
But you're not alone.
Almost everybody's passwords are bad cite:[BadPasswordsTroyHunt].
But don't feel too bad.
Your passwords are bad because everything you've been taught about passwords is probably wrong.

Let's fix that.

== What you're doing wrong
You've probably been making bad passwords for as long as you've been making passwords.
Let me guess what happens when you make a password:

*Step 1.* Use the same password you use for every other website. Something like `GoMavs123`. This is a "good" password because it's easy to remember. Plus, it has lowercase and uppercase letters, and even a number!

*Step 2.* The website tells you that you need a special character, so you add an exclamation point to the end: `GoMavs123!`.

*Step 3.* You're in.

Now, some people play this a little differently.
You might have 3 different passwords that you use depending on how "secure" you want to be on that site.
You might even have a password that changes slightly for each site you visit: `GoMavs123!`, `GoMavsFacebook123!`, `GoMavsTwitter123!`.
The fact is that most people simply can't remember enough passwords to have a unique one for every site you visit, so you take shortcuts.
That's completely understandable, but it means you have terrible passwords, and leaves you vulnerable.

Why is reusing passwords a bad idea?
Think about what happens when a website gets hacked (and the company is nice enough to let us know): they immediately send a notification to their users to change their passwords.
They might even lock your account until you go to the site to reset your password.
But what about all the other sites where you reused your password?
Do you go around to 20 different websites and update your password on all of them immediately?
Of course you don't.

// This needs a picture. Some diagram of what credential stuffing looks like. A password being entered into multiple sites, then being broken.

Unless you are extremely diligent about changing your password on every site with every hack, you are vulnerable to _credential stuffing_.
Credential stuffing is when hackers take passwords they stole from one website to try to log into another website.
For example, if hackers somehow got access to everybody's Twitter username and password, they could try logging into Facebook with the same username and password.
If the password doesn't work on Facebook, they could try LinkedIn, or Tumblr, or Gmail with the same username and password combo.
If you reuse your password on 20 different websites, you're in trouble on all of them even if only one gets hacked.

// This would be a great place to put the XKCD Password reuse comic https://xkcd.com/792/, but I'm afraid the stick figures might scare people.

Another reason your passwords are bad is because it's just hard to make up even one good password.
You've probably been taught that good password is long, random, and uses a bunch of different types of characters (lowercase, uppercase, symbols, and such).
The issue is that those passwords are awful to remember, so our poor little minds come up with shortcuts.
You probably use some of these shortcuts in your passwords. 
You might use a lyric from a song, with some letters swapped out for numbers or symbols.
Or you might take the lyrics of your favorite song and use the first letter of each word.
Even if you have a few good passwords, you still have problems remembering more than a few of them.
That's why a lot of people use common passwords, as shown in <<tbl-passwords>> cite:[Splashdata2017].

== Password managers
So if your password can't be short, and you're not supposed to reuse it, and you have to create 100 different, good passwords for 100 different websites, how are you supposed to remember them all?
Just don't!
Instead of trying to manage your own passwords, security experts today recommend using a password manager to remember passwords for you.
The job of a password manager is to provide a secure place for you to store your passwords.
The program stores your passwords in an encrypted file so you should be safe even if your computer gets stolen.

Once you have a password manager, you'll be creating strong, unique passwords for every website you visit in no time.
You can create one really good password that you have to remember (the password to the password manager), and the rest can be generated by the program.
For example, my password for one website I use is `+41aryY-o;u^W-x9G31^++` (well, it was. I changed it before I put that in here).
That's a great password: long, unique to one site, and it uses lots of different types of characters.
And the best part is that I don't have to remember it.
If I ever need to log into the site, I just copy the password from my password manager into the login form and I'm in.
It's one step harder than reusing a password, but so much more secure.

There are lots of different password managers out there, each with slightly different features.
Here are a few of the most popular programs:

* LastPass (https://www.lastpass.com/)
* KeePass (https://keepass.info/)
* DashLane (https://www.dashlane.com/)
* 1Password (https://1password.com/)

=== LastPass

NOTE: This is not an official product recommendation. I have no affiliation with LastPass. I just know it's a pretty good product that's easy to set up. I accept no responsibility if you choose to use LastPass.

One of the most popular password managers out there is LastPass.
It's probably the easiest way to get started using a password manager.
LastPass is great because it easily and securely syncs up your passwords so you can access your passwords on your phone, tablet, or computer when you need them.
With browser extensions you can easily enter your password on any website you're using without much trouble.
It can even automatically change your password on some sites if there is a hack on a site you use.

If you want to set up LastPass, you can head over to LastPass.com to get started.
<<img-lastpass>> shows a screenshot from a LastPass vault. 
Each of the sites listed there (and a couple hundred more you can't see) has a unique password stored in the database.

IMPORTANT: While using a password manager means you don't have to remember as many passwords, it is super important to use a good password to protect your password manager. That's the only one you need to remember ever again, so make it long and complicated. But make sure you remember what it is.

== Reflection Questions

. Why is it important to use a unique password for every account you use?
. Think about the passwords you currently use. How many different passwords do you have? How many are reused across various websites? What is good or bad about your own password use?
. Besides having good and unique passwords, some experts recommend having a different username for each website as well. What is the benefit of having different usernames?

== Activities

* Go to https://www.lastpass.com/password-generator and generate a few different passwords of different lengths and with different types of complexity. 
* Choose a password manager (for example: LastPass, Keepass, or Dashlane), create an account, and use it to set up passwords.
